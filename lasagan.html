            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For the Ragù Bolognese: Heat butter and olive oil in large Dutch Oven over high heat, 
                    stirring occasionally, until butter has stopped foaming. Add lamb, pork, veal, and chicken
                     livers, and cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 7-10 minutes. 
                     Remove from heat, transfer meat to strainer set in large bowl, allow to drain, then transfer 
                     drained liquid back to Dutch Oven. Add onions, carrots, celery, garlic, sage, and red pepper flakes,
                    and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, but not browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return meat to skillet, add tomatoes, wine, milk, stock, and bay leaves, and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and simmer 2 1/2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly below level of meat, about 2 quarts of sauce total (you may need to add excess stock while cooking if your burner is cooking it too hot). A layer of fat may form on top during cooking, but do not skim it off. After cooking, remove bay leaves, add fish sauce and heavy cream and simmer until fat is emulsified, about five minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and allow to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Stir in parsley and basil. Bolognese will keep for up to 1 week in fridge, and will improve with time. Reheat until warm before using in lasagna.</li>
                <li>While the ragù is simmering, make the ricotta mixture. Place ricotta in bowl of food processor or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment and process/mix until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add two eggs and minced herbs, and process/mix until incoroporated. Set aside at room temperature until ready to use.</li>
